/**
 * This defines an interface of the [LayoutlibInteractionHandler] downstream client.
 *
 * The client is supposed to work with panning interaction, basic mouse and keyboard events and
 * basic zooming. It is also supposed to be a [ScenesOwner] so that interactions can be passed
 * directly to the [Scene]s. [DataProvider] is only required to support [Pannable] delegating.
 *
 * TODO(b/228294269): Consider expanding this to generic [InteractionHandler] use. This interface
 *   should not extend [DataProvider]. This is only done so because of [Pannable] can be obtained
 *   with [PANNABLE_KEY].
