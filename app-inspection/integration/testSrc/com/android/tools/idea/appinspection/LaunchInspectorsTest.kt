   * Verifies that all inspectors are deployed successfully with a non-empty UI component after
   * opening the App Inspection tool window. <p> <pre> Test Steps:
   * 1. Import minapp in the testData directory of this module
   * 2. Add a few layout elements to the default activity
   * 3. Open the App Inspection tool window
   * 4. Wait until agent deployed
   * 5. Click Run
   * 6. From the device chooser dialog, select the running emulator and click Ok
   * 7. Open the App Inspection tool window again Verify: Project builds successfully and runs on
   *    the emulator Find specific UI components for all inspectors Find specific logs for all
   *    inspector deployments </pre>
   *
   * TODO(b/255808916): The test should be able to run as described above, with the App Inspection
   *   tool launched before the app. But for some reason, the app detaches if the inspectors are
   *   initialized right away. A workaround is to not deploy the inspectors until after the app has
   *   launched. When this bug is fixed, we should add another test so we have 2 versions. One with
   *   the inspectors tool already open when the app is launched, and another where the tool is
   *   started after the app is run.
