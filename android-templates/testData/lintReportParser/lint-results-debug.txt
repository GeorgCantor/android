C:\Windows\fakeProjectDir\testNewBasicViewsActivity_VALIDATING_\Template test module\src\main\res\layout\content_main.xml:8: Error: Replace the <fragment> tag with FragmentContainerView. [FragmentTagUsage from androidx.fragment]
    <fragment
     ~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "FragmentTagUsage":
   FragmentContainerView replaces the <fragment> tag as the preferred
          way of adding fragments via XML. Unlike the <fragment> tag,
   FragmentContainerView                 uses a normal FragmentTransaction
   under the hood to add the initial fragment,                 allowing
   further FragmentTransaction operations on the FragmentContainerView
           and providing a consistent timing for lifecycle events.

C:\Windows\fakeProjectDir\testNewBasicViewsActivity_VALIDATING_\Template test module\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml:18: Error: Redundant label can be removed [RedundantLabel]
            android:label="@string/app_name"
            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "RedundantLabel":
   When an activity does not have a label attribute, it will use the one from
   the application tag. Since the application has already specified the same
   label, the label on this activity can be omitted.

C:\Windows\fakeProjectDir\testNewBasicViewsActivity_VALIDATING_\gradle\libs.versions.toml:8: Error: A newer version of androidx.navigation:navigation-fragment than 2.6.0 is available: 2.7.0 [GradleDependency]
navigation-fragment = "2.6.0"
                      ~~~~~~~
C:\Windows\fakeProjectDir\testNewBasicViewsActivity_VALIDATING_\gradle\libs.versions.toml:9: Error: A newer version of androidx.navigation:navigation-ui than 2.6.0 is available: 2.7.0 [GradleDependency]
navigation-ui = "2.6.0"
                ~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "GradleDependency":
   This detector looks for usages of libraries where the version you are using
   is not the current stable release. Using older versions is fine, and there
   are cases where you deliberately want to stick with an older version.
   However, you may simply not be aware that a more recent version is
   available, and that is what this lint check helps find.

C:\Windows\fakeProjectDir\testNewBasicViewsActivity_VALIDATING_\Template test module\src\main\res\values-v23: Error: This folder configuration (v23) is unnecessary; minSdkVersion is 23. Merge all the resources in this folder into values. [ObsoleteSdkInt]

   Explanation for issues of type "ObsoleteSdkInt":
   This check flags version checks that are not necessary, because the
   minSdkVersion (or surrounding known API level) is already at least as high
   as the version checked for.

   Similarly, it also looks for resources in -vNN folders, such as values-v14
   where the version qualifier is less than or equal to the minSdkVersion,
   where the contents should be merged into the best folder.

C:\Windows\fakeProjectDir\testNewBasicViewsActivity_VALIDATING_\Template test module\src\main\res\layout\activity_main.xml:24: Error: Missing contentDescription attribute on image [ContentDescription]
    <com.google.android.material.floatingactionbutton.FloatingActionButton
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "ContentDescription":
   Non-textual widgets like ImageViews and ImageButtons should use the
   contentDescription attribute to specify a textual description of the widget
   such that screen readers and other accessibility tools can adequately
   describe the user interface.

   Note that elements in application screens that are purely decorative and do
   not provide any content or enable a user action should not have
   accessibility content descriptions. In this case, set their descriptions to
   @null. If your app's minSdkVersion is 16 or higher, you can instead set
   these graphical elements' android:importantForAccessibility attributes to
   no.

   Note that for text fields, you should not set both the hint and the
   contentDescription attributes since the hint will never be shown. Just set
   the hint.
