/**
 * Class responsible for handling all handshake logic:
 * 1. Starting the handshake for a newly connected device.
 * 3. Periodically repeating the handshake if the device has UNKNOWN support of foreground process
 *    detection.
 * 4. Logging handshake metrics.
 *
 * Handshake overview:
 *
 * When a device is connected, Layout Inspector sends a handshake requests to it, which can result
 * in:
 * 1. SUPPORTED
 * 2. NOT_SUPPORTED
 * 3. UNKNOWN - if the device has no foreground activity (for example the device is locked) or if
 *    foreground process detection is not supported on the device.
 *
 * When the support is UNKNOWN, the handshake is repeated periodically, until:
 * 1. UNKNOWN converts to SUPPORTED.
 * 2. UNKNOWN converts to NOT_SUPPORTED.
 * 3. The device is disconnected.
 *
 * This class can be re-used to execute multiple handshakes with [device]. For example to
 * double-check that a NOT_SUPPORTED state is not a false negative.
