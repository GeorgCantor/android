<p>Android API level 30 is the first version of Android that includes a version of SQLite that supports the boolean literals "TRUE" and
  "FALSE". See documentation for <a href="https://sqlite.org/datatype3.html">SQLite datatypes</a> and
  <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/database/sqlite/package-summary">Android SQLite versions</a>.</p>
<p>On lower API levels, the equivalent integer literals 1 (TRUE) and 0 (FALSE) should be used instead.</p>
