   * is dead (and thus the task is already complete/terminated), we want to load it up/display it. These two paths are built on the
   * following assumption: a task handler will not be entered until the new session tied to the task is successfully created and set as the
   * current/selected session. Therefore, the `mySelectedSession` of the SessionsManager (the session `isSessionAlive` is checking the
   * status of) will be correctly set before the task handler is entered.
   *
   * ProfilerTaskHandler#enter returns a boolean flag indicating whether the call to enter was successful (it was either able to start the
   * task or load the task with the supplied args). Note that the returned boolean only tells us if the ProfilerTaskHandlers' enter was
   * successful, it does not tell us if the startTask or loadTask functionality was successful.
