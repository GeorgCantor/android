            Device streaming in Android Studio lets you securely connect to remote physical
            Android devices hosted in Google's secure data centers. Powered by Firebase, it's the
            fastest and easiest way to test your app against real devices, including the Google
            Pixel 8 Pro, Pixel Fold, select Samsung devices, and more.

            <p>
            After connecting to a device, you can deploy your app, view the display, interact with
            the device (including rotating or unfolding the device), and anything else you might do
            with a device over a direct ADB over SSL connectionâ€”all without leaving Android Studio.
            When you're done using the device, Google wipes all your data and factory resets the
            device before making it available to another developer.
            </p>
            <p>
            During Open Alpha, you can use Device Streaming at no cost by simply logging into your
            Developer account and selecting a Firebase project. If you don't already have a Firebase
            project, it's free and easy to create one.

            You can now use Android Studio to build an app that implements Generative AI using the
            <a href="http://ai.google.dev/tutorials/android_quickstart?utm_source=android&utm_medium=referral">Google AI SDK</a>.
            The Gemini API template in Android Studio lets you incorporate AI-powered features, such
            as those that rely on text generation and image recognition, in your app to delight your
            users.
