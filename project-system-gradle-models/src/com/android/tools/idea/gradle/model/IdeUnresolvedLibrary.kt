 * Root of the hierarchy of interfaces representing unresolved IDE libraries as seen by the Android Gradle plugin.

 * change unresolved module libraries into one or more java libraries or resolved modules if required (ie. for KMP).
 *
 * "Resolved" in this case refers to whether the library has been mapped to the correct IDE objects, this is relevant only
 * for module libraries.
 *
 * This interface should not be exposed outside the Gradle import code, see [IdeLibrary] for the resolved counterparts which
