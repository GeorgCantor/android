/**
 * Service which lets clients communicate with the StudioBot backend via the chat UI.
 *
 * Use [StudioBot.chat] to look up an implementation of this service.
 *
 * There are two ways to send messages into the chat window:
 *
 * Using [sendChatQuery], queries may be sent directly to the model without modification,
 * and given a truncated representation in the chat timeline. But this is only allowed if the user
 * has opted into sharing code from their project, since such queries may attach arbitrary context
 * without being visible to the user.
 *
 * Alternatively, using [stageChatQuery] text can be pasted into the query bar without
 * being sent automatically. This API can be used regardless of the code sharing setting, since the user
 * is able to review the contents of the query before sending it.

   * If context sharing isn't allowed, then you must instead call [stageChatQuery] so that
   * the user has the chance to review the query before submitting.
   *
   * The query will be sent "as-is", without a preamble, chat history, or retrieved facts
   * being added.
